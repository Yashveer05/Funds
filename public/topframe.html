  Post the Industrial Revolution a lot of industries especially the clothing markets have bloomed. Evolution of E-commerce has enabled easy shopping ways, thus making it easier to buy many products at reasonable costs. Due to the rapid changes in fashion industries and also the unstable trends, a large number of clothes are purchased by people. Over some time in every other household, it is seen that a lot of good quality clothes are piled up and people have no idea how to recycle and reuse them. On the other hand, a part of the society cannot afford these necessities of food and clothing. Various social work organizations are working towards the development of these factors.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our idea is to design a system that will enable people to donate clothes that can either be donated further to needful people to use or sent for recycling. From the clothes thatâ€™ll be segregated for recycling bags of different types will be made. The account of all the data regarding the number of clothes that were collected from the donations, number of the onessent for reuse and the remaining sent for recycling, the number of bags and their costs and other data related to the delivery, reports, etc will be maintained using a database. The bags made from recycling clothes will then be made available for selling on the site. The money generated from these transactions will be provided as funds to various social welfare Organizations.
